title: Why URNs?

The Uniform Resource Name (URN) system was defined by the Internet Engineering Taskforce to address precisely our fundamental scholarly problem .    To quote from [RFC 2141](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2141):

> Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent, location-independent, resource identifiers.

By defining URN schemes for scholarly citation of texts, images and other objects, we address the fundamental requirement of identifiers that are:

- semantically complete
- technology independent 
- machine actionable
