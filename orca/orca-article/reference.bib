	abstract = {Thisbookcontainsthepostproceedingsofthe6thEuropeanWorkshoponPublic Key Services, Applications and Infrastructures, which was held at the {CNR} Research Area in Pisa, Italy, in September 2009. The {EuroPKI} workshop series focuses on all research and practice aspects of public key infrastructures, services and applications, and welcomes original research papers and excellent survey contributions from academia, government, and industry. Previous events of the series were held in: Samos, Greece (2004); Kent, {UK} (2005); Turin, Italy, (2006); Palma de Mallorca, Spain, (2007); and Trondheim, Norway (2008). From the original focus on public key infrastructures, {EuroPKI} interests - panded to include advanced cryptographic techniques, applications and (more generally) services. The Workshops brings together researchersfrom the cryp- graphiccommunity as well as fromthe applied security community, as witnessed by the interesting program. Indeed, this volume holds 18 refereed papers and the presentation paper by the invited speaker, Alexander Dent. In response to the {EuroPKI} 2009 call for papers, a total of 40 submissions were received. All submissions underwent a thorough blind review by at least three {ProgramCommittee} members, resulting in careful selection and revision of the accepted papers. After the conference, the papers were revised and improved by the authors before inclusion in this volume.},

	abstract = {This paper reports work on a catalog that includes not only standard metadata but also a complete reference transcription for each work so that users can explicitly cite not only every version but also every word in every version of a work. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records conceptual model ({FRBR}) allows us to move beyond printed books and to track the logical units within (and often across) printed books: works (e.g., the Iliad) and expressions (e.g., versions such as the 10th century Venetus A manuscript or Butler's English translation). The Canonical Text Services ({CTS}) Data Model builds upon {FRBR}, allowing us to cite each word in any version of a text and to do so by building upon established citation schemes inherited from print (e.g., the chapter/verse citation scheme in the Bible). This paper describes a concrete implementation of such a catalogue of 3,679 Greek and Latin works that includes {FRBR} inspired metadata and {TEI} {XML} transcriptions that were revised to facilitate implementing a {CTS} {API}. It also describes how all the different versions of a work can be serialized as variations on the reference version. The {FRBR}+{CTS} catalog provides data by which text re-use and alignment services can automatically detect different versions of and quotations from the reference text, aligning all discovered instances according to a canonical citation scheme.},
