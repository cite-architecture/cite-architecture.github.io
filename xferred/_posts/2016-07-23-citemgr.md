title: "citemgr uses updated cite and hocuspocus libraries"
---

Version 3.0 of `citemgr` incorporates [yesterday's updates](http://cite-architecture.github.io/2016/07/22/cite_and_hp/) to the `hocuspocus` and `cite` libraries.  This means that `citemgr` can now prepare citable texts formatted in any mix of XML, "bland markdown" and delimited-text formats for use in the `cs2` Canonical Text Service with the single command `gradle ctsttl`.
