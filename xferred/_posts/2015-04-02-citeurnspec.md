title: Initial release of CITE Object URN specification
layout: post
---

We're releasing an initial draft of a formal specifcation for CITE Object URNs.  You can [read it online](http://cite-architecture.github.io/citeurn_spec/), or get the markdown source from [its github repository](https://github.com/cite-architecture/citeurn_spec).

Going forward, work related to the CITE Collection Service will rely on this formal specification to identify unique objects with technology-independent URNs.
