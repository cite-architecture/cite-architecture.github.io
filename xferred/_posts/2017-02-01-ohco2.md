title: "New OHCO2 library"
---

`ohco2` is a library for working with citable texts.
Like the `xcite` library [announced yesterday](http://cite-architecture.github.io/2017/01/30/overhaul/), the 3.x series of `ohco2` is cross-compiled for both the JVM and ScalaJS using scala versions 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12, and is  therefore available for JVM environments and for use in javascript compiled with ScalaJS.

Version 3.1 adds the twiddle operator `~~` for URN matching on corpora of texts.  In `xcite`, twiddling two URNs is a boolean function, e.g.,

    val iliad = CtsUrn("urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:")
    val venetusA = CtsUrn("urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:")
    assert (iliad ~~ venetusA)

In `ohco2`, twiddling a corpus with a URN is a functio mapping the corpus to a (possibly empty) new corpus of text contents with matching URN, e.g., you could select the text of the Venetus A edition of the *Iliad* by twiddling a larger corpus like so:

    val corpus = Corpus("YOURDATASET...")
    val vaText = corpus ~~ venetusA


Binaries for all platforms are available from jcenter (<https://bintray.com/neelsmith/maven/ohco2>).  Source code is hosted on github (<https://github.com/cite-architecture/ohco2>).
