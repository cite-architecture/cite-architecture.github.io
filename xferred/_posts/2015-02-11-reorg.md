title:  Site reorganization

We've changed how we build the github pages hosted at <http://cite-architecture.github.io/>.  We're now building the site with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), using a theme modified from [the lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). 

We can easily add API documentation and live specifications rendered by running [concordion tests](http://concordion.org/) to the individual subsites (github project pages).
