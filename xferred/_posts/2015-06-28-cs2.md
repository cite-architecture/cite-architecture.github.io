title: "A new project: citeservlet, second generation"
---


We are beginning work on a new project.  `cs2` is more than just a a second version of the original `citeservlet`:  it is a ground-up redesign resulting from a rethinking of how the abstract models of the CITE architecture could be expressed in network services and exposed to the internet as an RDF graph.  It addition to new implementations of familiar data models like the OHCO2 model of texts, it includes the new ORCA model describing how citable analyses of texts can be related to the OHCO2 semantics of the texts they analyze.

In  terms of the practical organization of the project, we are developing `cs2` as a single gradle build, with subprojects building each of the CITE services.  We will be posting notes here as we progress with different parts of `cs2`.
