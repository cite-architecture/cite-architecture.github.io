File this under "work in progress."

In 2017, the IETF developed a new [RFC on the topic of Uniform Resource Names](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141) (URNs).  We hope to register both the `cts` and `cite2` namespaces with the  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and will be working with members of the IETF's URN team to formally request registration of those two namespaces.


We'll post news here as the process develops.  In the meantime, if you have comments or suggestions about the current somewhat informal descriptions of the CITE Architecture's two URN schemes, please share them with us!  You can post issues to the github repository with the source for this web site:  <https://github.com/cite-architecture/cite-architecture.github.io/issues>.
