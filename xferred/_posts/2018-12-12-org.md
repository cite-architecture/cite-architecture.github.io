This web site will continue to be hosted as github pages at <https://cite-architecture.github.io>, but it is now available as well at <http://cite-archtiecture.org>.


<http://cite-archtiecture.org> is running in a droplet hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), where we are currently installing a suite of microservices using [scs-akka](https://github.com/cite-architecture/scs-akka) to provide a URN-aware API for querying and retrieving data aboiut CTS and CITE2 URN subnamespaces.  We'll post updates here as those come on line.
