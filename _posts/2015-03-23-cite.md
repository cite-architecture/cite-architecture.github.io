Version 0.93.3 of the `cite` library includes bug fixes to the handling of URNs by the TextInventory object.  It is now available either from the github repository at <https://github.com/cite-architecture/cite> or as a maven artifact from the nexus repository at <http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/nexus/index.html>.  `hocuspocus` in turn has been tested with the new library and updated to version 0.12.6.
