CITE Manager is an automated build system, using gradle, to help you manage CITE repositories. Version 0.6 of `citemgr` organizes the build into two subprojects.   Users inerested only in applying CITE Manager to their own projects can ignore the `core` subproject, a standard gradle build for assembling a code library. The `projects` subproject offers tasks for unifying the contents of one ore more CITE repositories in a single RDF graph that can be configured from a single configuration file.

See the project web page: <http://cite-architecture.github.io/citemgr/>.
