title: The CITE Object URN
layout: page
---

CITE Object URNs provide permanent canonical references to discrete objects in Collections. CITE Object URNs are a kind of Uniform Resource Name (URN).


A draft formal specification is under development.  We plan to release it together with a test suite that can be used to validate candidate URNs.
