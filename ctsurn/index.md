CTS URNs provide  permanent canonical references to texts or passages of text.  CTS URNs are a kind of Uniform Resource Name (URN). To quote from RFC 2141:

>Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent, location-independent, resource identifiers.


The semantics of CTS URNs capture the [OHCO2](ohco2) model of text.
